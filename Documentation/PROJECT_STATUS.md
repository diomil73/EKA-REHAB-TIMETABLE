# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-10-17

## Current stage

Branch: `feature/outpatient-scheduling`.

Active milestone: **authoritative restore hardening + selected/all restore**.

## Latest confirmed checkpoints

- full regression: **699 passed, 19 warnings**
- replacement fact focused gate: **28 passed, 3 warnings in 5.14s**
- versioned-id + single/batch restore focused gate: **36 passed in 4.74s**
- rerun gate after V90 persistence fix: **37 passed in 7.13s**
- V87 mixed orphan scenario: **native green**
- V88 full restart reconstruction: **native green**
- V89 single authoritative restore + reconstruction: **native green**
- V90 re-placement + reconstruction + versioned lifecycle: **native green**
- V91 selected authoritative restore: **native green**
- V91 fresh reconstruction: **native green**

Python 3.14 `ZipFile.__del__` teardown warnings remain non-blocking technical debt.

## CLOSED: restart-safe authoritative daily state

The operational day is reconstructable from durable facts:

`recurring/base + DAILY_INPUT + ACTIVE DAILY_REPLACEMENT_FACTS -> DailySessionState -> statistics`

V88 proved this across a fresh process with 5 replacements, 2 suspensions, unresolved=0, finalized=ΝΑΙ, and exact `DAILY_STATISTICS` equivalence.

## CLOSED: versioned replacement lifecycle

Replacement facts now preserve immutable history across restore/re-placement cycles:

- original generation keeps the legacy id
- re-placement after restore becomes `:v2`
- later cycles become `:v3`, etc.

V90 proved this natively: the original planner:57 fact remained `RESTORED`, the later placement became a distinct `:v2` ACTIVE fact, and fresh reconstruction remained exact.

## ACTIVE: atomic selected/all restore

Implemented rules:

- validate the entire requested restore set before mutation
- any missing/stale/already-restored member aborts the complete batch
- no partial restore
- selected restore by repeated exact ids
- restore-all over all ACTIVE facts
- one authoritative mutation batch
- one daily-state recompute
- one statistics rewrite
- preserve source workbook and VBA

Key files:

- `Python/rehab_excel/daily_replacement_fact_batch.py`
- `Python/tools/restore_daily_replacement_facts.py`
- `Tests/test_daily_replacement_fact_batch.py`
- `Tests/test_authoritative_bulk_daily_restore.py`

## V91 selected restore and reconstruction result

`Excel/previews/SELECTED_RESTORE_V91.xlsm` was created from V90 by restoring exactly two ACTIVE replacement facts:

- `daily-input:planner:57:ΦΘ@2026-10-19:2026-10-19:v2`
- `daily-input:planner:61:ΦΘ@2026-10-19:2026-10-19`

Native restore result:

- restored replacement facts=2
- active replacements after restore=3
- unresolved sessions after recompute=2
- finalized after recompute=ΟΧΙ
- source unchanged=True
- VBA preserved=True

Fresh reconstruction then confirmed independently from the saved V91 workbook:

- persisted replacements reread=3
- treatment suspensions reread=2
- reconstructed unresolved=2
- reconstructed finalized=ΟΧΙ
- stored `DAILY_STATISTICS` matches reconstructed daily state exactly

This closes the selected multi-fact authoritative restore proof.

Current status: **V91 is fully green. Next is independent V92 restore-all from V90.**

## Immediate roadmap

1. Run `restore_daily_replacement_facts.py --all-active` from trusted V90 into `RESTORE_ALL_V92.xlsm`.
2. Expect 5 restored, 0 active, unresolved=5, finalized=ΟΧΙ, source unchanged=True, VBA preserved=True.
3. Fresh-verify V92; expect 0 active replacements, 2 suspensions, unresolved=5, finalized=ΟΧΙ, and exact `DAILY_STATISTICS` equivalence.
4. Inspect V92 replacement fact inventory if needed.
5. Connect Excel ledger per-row/selected/all controls to the authoritative backend; retire old cell-copy VBA only after native bridge validation.
6. Resume outpatient recurring create/edit native gate.
7. Later clean Python 3.14 ZipFile warnings.

## Locked daily rules

1. recurring/base schedule
2. cancellations/no-shows release capacity
3. therapist absences
4. identify displaced/orphan sessions
5. apply surviving ACTIVE replacements
6. unresolved orphans resolve through placement or treatment suspension
7. only then expose capacity to new patients

Operational capacity is timeslot-based. Daily facts never destructively edit recurring schedules. Existing displaced patients precede new patients. MASTER and THERAPIST_DAILY must agree.

## Documentation discipline

Every meaningful evolution must be recorded in repository documentation during the same work cycle, including implemented changes, regressions, native validation results, newly discovered necessities, planned additions, removals, replacements, and deferred fixes. Chat history is not the sole source of truth.

## Deferred issue

Legacy `ΑΝΑΝΕΩΣΗ` Form Control remains manual/deferred cosmetic cleanup.

## Safety constraints

- never write directly to baseline `.xlsm` during development
- preview workflows use copies
- preserve and verify VBA
- keep layout write zones narrow
- existing replacement facts must never be re-appended during rerun
- partial preview files created before a later persistence failure must be removed
- bulk restore validates the whole set before any mutation
- Windows tests use `python -m pytest`

## Recovery order

1. `Documentation/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`
2. `Documentation/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md`
3. `Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
4. `Documentation/DECISIONS.md`
5. active tests
