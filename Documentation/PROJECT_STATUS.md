# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-10-20

## Entry point

New developers and new contexts start from `Documentation/ONBOARDING.md`. This file tracks milestone state, risks and immediate roadmap only.

Branch: `feature/outpatient-scheduling`.

## Current stage

Active milestone: **statistics/history design checkpoint**.

CREATE is native green. The application-style manager is visible and usable in native Excel. The duplicate outpatient edit bug was reproduced and hardened. The therapist/time collision path and workload refresh were reworked and the latest fresh native smoke was reported by the user as behaving correctly. Workload visibility is present on MASTER and the outpatient edit/conflict/workload milestone is treated as operationally green, subject to broader regression later.

The THERAPIST_DAILY presentation cleanup source gate is now green: **27 passed in 3.09s**. Neutral outpatient text and robotic-orange precedence are covered without changing scheduling truth or workload semantics.

The project now enters the dedicated statistics/history design checkpoint before deep global multi-absence optimizer work. This checkpoint must lock historical facts, weekly therapist workload history, retention and dashboard semantics before implementation begins.

Restore correctness is closed green. Restore performance is deferred.

## Latest confirmed checkpoints

- full regression checkpoint: **699 passed, 19 warnings**
- package relationship normalization + OOXML projection gate: **59 passed in 6.85s**
- latest direct restore backend profile: **16.509s total**
- `build_master_projection`: **0.089s**
- V87-V92 authoritative restore/reconstruction lifecycle: **native green**
- per-row / selected / restore-all in-session restore correctness: **native green**
- previous combined outpatient recurring smoke build: **native green**, trusted source unchanged
- outpatient recurring CREATE: **native green**
- outpatient manager: **native visible and usable**
- duplicate-fix focused gate: **45 passed, 4 warnings in 4.98s**
- collision/workload focused gate: **33 passed, 5 warnings in 4.60s**
- latest native outpatient collision + valid reassignment + workload scenario: **user reported it appears correct**
- THERAPIST_DAILY presentation cleanup gate: **27 passed in 3.09s**

Python 3.14 `ZipFile.__del__` teardown warnings remain non-blocking technical debt.

## Closed: restart-safe authoritative daily state

Operational truth is reconstructable from:

`recurring/base + DAILY_INPUT + ACTIVE DAILY_REPLACEMENT_FACTS -> DailySessionState -> statistics/views`

Replacement facts preserve immutable lifecycle history. Restore correctness, reconstruction and daily statistics parity are native green.

## Closed: Excel ledger authoritative restore correctness

`DAILY_REPLACEMENT_FACTS` is authoritative. `DAILY_CHANGE_LEDGER` is only a projection/audit view.

Primary restore UX keeps the workbook open, runs Python hidden/blocking, protects rollback, imports verified state in-session and avoids visible console / close-reopen behavior.

## Outpatient recurring management + therapist workload UI

Current technical path supports recurring outpatient creation/edit, application-style management, conflict popup/guard, stable same-row identity, daily projection cleanup, workload badges and automatic refresh after outpatient changes.

### Therapist workload strip contract

The workload strip shows one badge per therapist in the form `Όνομα n/6`, where `n` is the number of occupied timeslots in the current operational day. It intentionally counts occupied timeslots, not patient lines, so a legitimate shared slot consumes one capacity unit.

Color thresholds for the normal 6-slot therapist capacity:

- **0-4 / 6: green**,
- **5 / 6: yellow/orange**,
- **6 / 6 or above: red**.

Normal users must not see raw sheet/grid/tab navigation, worksheet row numbers or `outpatient:<row>` IDs.

## Closed source gate: THERAPIST_DAILY presentation consistency

Outpatient text no longer relies on a special font color for identity. The presentation layer keeps outpatient text neutral black while robotic treatment retains orange precedence. The focused gate is green at **27 passed in 3.09s**.

This cleanup is presentation-only and does not alter recurring storage, daily truth, row identity or workload counts.

## Active: statistics/history design checkpoint

Before implementing long-term reporting, explicitly decide what historical facts are persisted and what is only a derived view. At minimum the design must cover:

- weekly workload history per therapist,
- daily occupied-timeslot and active-session facts,
- cancellations/no-shows/replacements/suspensions,
- historical changes of therapist assignment,
- finalized-day snapshot semantics,
- retention and comparison periods,
- dashboards and user-facing reports.

Historical metrics must derive from persisted historical facts/events, not from today's mutable projection.

## Open: replacement quality under multiple therapist absences

Replacement lifecycle correctness is green, but global assignment quality remains open.

Required global behavior:

- enter all known therapist absences first,
- solve all displaced patients together,
- maximize placements / minimize unresolved orphans,
- protect unique viable slots from flexible patients,
- prefer original time when higher-priority constraints permit,
- preserve ΦΘ/reclining proximity where feasible,
- avoid significant provider-load imbalance,
- respect patient absences and other treatments,
- add persistent pool/robotic operating-hour configuration,
- treat 13:00 as a weak soft preference to avoid,
- permit double-booking/over-capacity only through explicit last-resort user approval.

Canonical scarcity example: A can use 09:00/10:00/11:00, B only 09:00, so protect 09:00 for B when a complete feasible solution exists.

This must be addressed before replacements are considered complete.

## Deferred: restore performance

Current end-user restore duration in the low-to-mid 20-second range is accepted for this stage. Do not resume performance work unless there is a regression or final-polish phase.

## Immediate roadmap

1. Hold the statistics/history design session now and lock the historical fact model before coding it.
2. Define weekly therapist workload history, including both occupied timeslots and active-session counts.
3. Define finalized-day snapshot/event semantics so later schedule edits do not rewrite history.
4. Define the first user-facing statistics/dashboard views and comparison periods.
5. Implement the smallest persistent historical slice with tests before adding broader reports.
6. Resume broader scheduling/UI work after the history contract is stable.
7. Implement global multi-absence optimization and persistent special-service operating hours before replacements are considered complete.
8. Revisit restore performance near completion.

## Locked daily rules

1. recurring/base schedule,
2. cancellations/no-shows release slots,
3. therapist absences,
4. identify displaced/orphan sessions,
5. apply surviving ACTIVE replacements,
6. unresolved orphans resolve through valid placement or treatment suspension,
7. only then expose capacity to new patients.

Capacity is timeslot-based. Existing displaced patients precede new patients. MASTER and THERAPIST_DAILY must agree.

## Safety constraints

- baseline `.xlsm` is immutable,
- preview/smoke workflows use fresh copies,
- preserve VBA and source hash,
- keep write zones narrow,
- bulk restore validates the entire requested set before mutation,
- no production/staging `.xlsm` save with openpyxl,
- no manual Save in independent smoke scenarios,
- Windows tests use `python -m pytest`.

## Documentation discipline

`Documentation/ONBOARDING.md` is the single front door. Specialist files keep their own source-of-truth roles. Meaningful changes must update the relevant specialist document in the same cycle, and ONBOARDING when the project-wide mental model changes.
