## CLOSED: authoritative daily truth and replacement lifecycle

Concrete daily truth is reconstructable from:

`recurring/base + DAILY_INPUT + ACTIVE DAILY_REPLACEMENT_FACTS -> DailySessionState -> statistics`

Replacement facts preserve immutable history. First placement keeps the legacy id, re-placement after restore gets `:v2`, later cycles get `:v3`, etc. Restore never rewrites a newer lifecycle fact.

Atomic selected/all backend restore is implemented and native green independently through V91/V92: validate the whole requested set before mutation, no partial restore, one fact mutation batch, one daily-state recompute, one statistics rewrite, source/VBA preservation.

## CLOSED: Excel ledger authoritative restore correctness

`DAILY_REPLACEMENT_FACTS` is authoritative. `DAILY_CHANGE_LEDGER` is a projection. The smoke-copy builder rebuilds the ledger from durable facts and preserves matching audit/snapshot extras by immutable ReplacementId.

The primary Excel restore path now keeps the workbook open, launches Python hidden and blocking, creates a rollback copy, imports the verified operational state in-session, and saves the workbook. The obsolete visible-console and close/reopen lifecycle is not part of the normal path.

Native correctness is green for all three Excel controls:

- per-row restore
- selected multi-row restore
- restore-all

Restore-all was verified from an independent V90 copy with the expected final state:

- ACTIVE replacements: 0
- treatment suspensions: 2
- unresolved sessions: 5
- finalized: ΟΧΙ
- stored `DAILY_STATISTICS` matches fresh reconstruction
- historical replacement facts remain auditable as RESTORED
- workbook stayed open during the action, with no visible console

User-facing `Αιτία` is Greek-only for known replacement causes. Technical/internal reason values such as `DAILY_INPUT therapist absence` and `temporary replacement` render as `Απουσία θεραπευτή`. Internal immutable IDs remain unchanged.

## ACTIVE: restore performance / UX

Correctness is closed. The remaining ledger item is latency: selected and restore-all actions still take longer than acceptable for normal use.

Three performance patches are now on the branch:

- Bulk selected/all restore marks all restored ledger rows in one hidden Excel session instead of reopening Excel once per ReplacementId. Implementation `fb445bbc08e6d2cbfd63820a13f8dc504192e954`, tests `de7dbe61a8bae19e469cbe93c309a6fcdf18d4c7`.
- Daily statistics write and ledger finalization are consolidated into the same hidden Excel session, removing one more workbook open/save/close cycle. Implementation `d92dda3b82b9d12ea32e63592cfe80110f5af22c`, tests `7b38e29996a17557190984f5ab9763382e1ab33e`.
- In-session apply no longer performs the redundant second pre-rollback `ThisWorkbook.Save`, nor a second ledger refresh/save after importing the already-verified preview. The source is still saved once before backend execution, a full rollback copy is still created, and the imported authoritative state is still saved once after synchronization. Implementation `4b58085fc416c456c603aefd1ae2942022715632`, tests `55b7e584080d6f9f657ce3b274dae9a90a85aa19`.

Focused source gate after the second patch is green: `30 passed in 4.39s`. The third patch still needs the focused Windows test gate and a fresh native timing smoke.

Remaining likely hotspots after this save-cycle cleanup are the MASTER projection Excel session, native write-plan Excel session, verified-preview open, and broad `UsedRange` synchronization.

## Exact resume point

1. Pull latest branch.
2. Run `python -m pytest Tests/test_authoritative_bulk_daily_restore.py Tests/test_daily_restore_in_session_vba.py Tests/test_daily_change_ledger_vba.py Tests/test_daily_restore_bridge_preview.py -q`.
3. If green, rebuild a fresh `LEDGER_ALL_SMOKE.xlsm` from trusted V90. Never reuse an already-restored smoke workbook for timing.
4. Run restore-all without a manual extra save and compare elapsed time with the previous attempt.
5. Run fresh reconstruction to prove the save-cycle optimization did not alter authoritative state.
6. If latency remains high, next target is consolidation of the MASTER projection and native write-plan Excel phases, then narrowing broad in-session sheet synchronization.
7. Once restore latency is acceptable, resume outpatient recurring create/edit native gate.

## Locked orphan rule

Every orphan for the concrete date resolves as exactly one of:

- valid therapist/time placement, or
- `Αναστολή θεραπείας` for that date only.

Suspension = `DailySessionStatus.CANCELLED` + `SessionCancellationKind.TREATMENT_SUSPENDED`. Recurring/base remains untouched. A finalized day requires unresolved=0.

## Locked recomputation order

1. recurring/base schedule
2. cancellations/no-shows release capacity
3. therapist absences
4. identify displaced/orphan sessions
5. apply surviving ACTIVE replacements
6. resolve remaining orphans by placement or suspension
7. only then expose capacity to new patients

Operational capacity is timeslot-based. Existing displaced patients precede new patients. MASTER and THERAPIST_DAILY must agree.

## Documentation discipline

Meaningful changes, regressions, native results, decisions, needs, planned additions/removals/fixes must be recorded in repository documentation during the same work cycle. Chat history is not the sole source of truth.

## Legacy `ΑΝΑΝΕΩΣΗ`

Deferred/manual cosmetic cleanup. Not a blocker.

## Recovery order if context is lost

1. `Documentation/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`
2. `Documentation/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md`
3. `Documentation/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
4. `Documentation/DECISIONS.md`
5. active tests

Windows: always `python -m pytest`, never bare `pytest`.
